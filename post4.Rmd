### - Post Aim
The aim of this 4th blog-post is to make a peer review of an R-package developed by one of my classmates while cursing the "ETC5523-Communicating with Data" unit at Monash University. The package that I will review is called `prikage` and it was developed by **Ms. Priya Ravindra Dingorkar.**

<br> 

### - Package Overview
The goal of `prikage` R-package is embedding a Shiny application built by Ms. Priya, allowing external users launching the App through an external function called `launch_app()`. It was the first experience for Ms. Priya building an R-package and a Shiny application, so given this, the results are amazing. When the user download the package and launchs the Shiny application, she starts to navigate through an overview data exploration about the COVID-19 pandemic information displayed into interactive graphs and tables. The application starts with a globally vision of the data, progressing to detail the data in Australia by its states, and at the end giving some statistical knowledge for each country selected by the user.

<br> 

### - Working Review
The package by itself has all the minimal and necessary components that a R-package asks for and worked very well without any bug, successfully attending the purpose task for what it was built as well as offering to user a good exploratory analysis and visualization about this world current pandemic. So, I can easily declare that this package did what I was expecting: a good and informative navegation through an Shiny app without errors stopping my exploration experience.

Progressing for the package documentation, we find a good README with the enough information about the package aims, installlation procedures, examples of usage and output, and a link for more details in the `pkgdown` page. In the `pkgdown` page all the detailed information and guidelines about the package and Shiny application are given in a objective and well written text. As differential of this package we can cite the amazing and creative logo created for the package. Thus, overall, we can consider that the documentation is more than sufficient to get started and that package is extremely well documented.

About the package code part, besides the initial `launch_app()` external function, Ms. Priya has also created more 5 external functions in order to simplify the structure of Shiny app. This functions are called inside the ui and server files, making the running of the application code much more agile. Tests were done and the package also presented a "passing" status thorough the R-CMD-check giving more security for the user in the package usage.

<br> 

### - Suggestions for improvement

Despite the beatiful work executed by Ms. Priya, as imperfect humans we have always something to improve. So, I've listed some suggestions that in my persoonal view could become her work still better:

**a) related to the code**

* **inclusion of examples for the external functions built for the package** --> we cannot notice the examples for the external functions built in the package. The examples are very useful for the user fully understanding how the functions work.

* **declaration of global functions inside the `date_slider_input()` and `select_input_world_countries()`** --> adjusting this point the R CMD check results ran locally should pass without any "note" warning, what is important to our package get the credentials to be distributed by R.

* **inclusion of at least one test for each external function from package** --> Ms. Priya built tests just for 2 functions from the 6 external functions of the package. With at least one test by each external function, we can offer more tranquility of well working and integrity for the users. Adding more inputs in the test also colaborate in this direction.


**b) related to the shiny app**

* **interactive table in the "WorlWide Statistics" tab** --> here there is an small working issue to be fixed: in the selection box of "Show xx entries", despite the options 10, 25, 50 and 100, just the option 10 entries is being displaying even when we choose to display another quantity different from 10. This interaction is not working properly.

* **map in the first tab** --> if the size of the circles were differentiated by the proportion of cases maybe would add more information becoming this map still more useful.

* **adjustments in the pictures size** --> the pictures inserted at the beginning of each navegation tab was a very cool idea to become the navigation not boring. However, the quality of images are not very good, reducing the impact of this good idea. Maybe some adjustments in the size of images could fix this issue.

### - What I have learned 

<br> 

### - Appendix 

#### Package Review Checklist

#### a. Documentation:
The package includes all the following forms of documentation: 

- [ YES ] **Installation instructions:** for the package is found in README
- [ YES ] **Vignette(s)** demonstrating major functionality that runs successfully locally
- [ YES ] **Function Documentation:** for all exported functions in R help
- [ NO ] **Examples** for all exported functions in R Help that run successfully locally --> *ANSWER: For all 6 exported functions built for the package were not provided any example.*


#### b. Functionality: 

- [ YES ] **Installation:** Installation succeeds as documented. 

- [ YES ] **Functionality:** Any functional claims of the software been confirmed. --> *ANSWER:  Concerning to the overall test `devtools::check()`, running it locally in my machine, returned 0 errors, 0 warnings, but 2 notes about the absense of usage of some global functions. The check result recommended the definition of some global functions inside two external functions built for this package: `date_slider_input()`, `select_input_world_countries()`.* 

- [ More or Less ] **Automated tests:** Unit tests cover essential functions of the package
and a reasonable range of inputs and conditions. All tests pass on the local machine. --> *ANSWER: The units tests covered only two of the six functions of the package. Just one input was tested for each test created. Using the `devtools::test()`, all tests passed locally in my machine without errors but with 32 warnings.*
