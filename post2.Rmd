### Introduction 

Hi everyone! Let's continue our Covid-19 post's series discussing today the Portugal Covid-19 data, keeping exploring the effects of this terrible pandemic over the European continent. Portugal is much smaller than the UK and has a lower population density, which consequently leads to the distinct impacts of Covid-19 over this country.

However, this time, the story of this disease spread will be told more visually, navigating through graphs instead through tables. Firstly, we will see the current situation of the overall country data to explore the general pandemic happenings. In sequence, we will be zooming by geographical macro-regions to explore the different patterns of this disease along with the different country's area. 

<br> 

### The Data
  
As in the last post, the data was sourced from https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data, which is maintained by the "Our World Data" organization. This daily dataset contains data on confirmed cases, deaths, and testing, and other variables from several countries. However, to explore the data by the macro-regions of Portugal, at this time we joined an additional dataset sourced from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/europe-covid-19-subnational-cases. This second dataset contains the number of confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths by country and subnational region due to the Coronavirus pandemic in Europe. This data is maintained by "The Humanitarian Data Exchange" organization.

<br> 

### **a) Data Story 1**: COVID-19 pandemic evolution over the whole country - *the worst is behind!*

Portugal started to record the Covid-19 information from March 2020, and the first cases were registered on 3rd March 2020. The data displayed by the graphs below are updated up to the end of August 2020. We will explore the pandemic numbers through two sets of plottings:   
  
  1. **Set 1**: one graph displaying the daily evolution of **new and total cases**, and another showing the daily evolution of **new and total deaths**.
  2. **Set 2**: some ridgeline graphs exploring the rates of transmission, testings, and fatalities.
  
The first two graphs plot the daily information of confirmed **cases** (at left) and confirmed **deaths** (at right). Both charts have two y-axes: one measuring the daily recordings (shown by the bars), and the other y-axis measuring accumulated recording (indicated by the line).  

The data shows that a total of almost 60,000 Covid-19 cases have been recorded, and the sum of deaths are close to achieving 2,000 deceases. However,  it looks like the worst is behind us, despite a likely second wave of Covid-19 emerging in late August. Indeed, the first plot shows an acceleration of the curve of the total cases (purple curve). However, despite this apparent 2nd wave, the daily and total amount of deaths in Graph 2 remains flat, indicating that the treatments against Covid-19 are more efficient now. Similar to observed with the UK, this fact leads us to infer that the treatment of Covid-19 patients has evolved.

The second set of graphs confirms this point. We can note in the plot (A) that the average of the positive testings rate has been systematically decreasing, even with the mean percentage of performed testings (B) increasing (which either explains the recent growth trend of new cases). And by (C) we notice that the average mortality rate (around 1%) is the lowest observed since the beginning of the pandemic crises.

### **b) Data Story 2**: COVID-19 pandemic evolution over macro-regions of Portugal - *attention to Lisbon region!*

Here the 1st graph shows the total Covid-19 cases for each macro-region, while the second one displays the total number of deaths. The conclusions are as follows:

* By the 1st graph, we see that the total number of cases among the regions are following similar patterns of acceleration since the end of August. However, the Lisbon region shows a bit higher acceleration than the other areas.
* In the 2nd graph we observe that the total of deaths seems to be flattened (like in the overall country view), but again the Lisbon region calls our attention, displaying a distinct trend of deaths' acceleration, that should be investigated with attention.
