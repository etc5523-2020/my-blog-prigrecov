Hello!

I am a Master of Data Science student at Monash University in my last semester, and I'm passionate about data science and all its potentials. After studying a lot about the data exploration, data modelling and data analytics, during this my last semester I am concetrating in studying data visualisation and how to communicate my analytical results, in a effective way.

This blog contains the experiments and products learned through the unit course ETC5523: Communicating with Data. In this course we train the communication skills related to data analysis, learning how to build a website, a web app, reports and presentations as part of a data analysis workflow.
