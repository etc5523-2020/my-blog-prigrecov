**I am a postgraduate student of Data Science at Monash University, and I'm passionate about data science and all its potentials. After studying a lot about the data exploration, data modelling and data analytics, during this semester, I am concentrating on learning data visualisation and how to communicate my analytical results, effectively.**

**This blog contains the experiments and products learned through the unit course ETC5523: Communicating with Data. In this course, we train the communication skills related to data analysis, learning how to build a website, a web app, reports and presentations as part of a data analysis workflow.**
